# Cookie Banner Behavior - Fixed ✅

## How It Works Now

### 1. Accept All Button
- ✅ Immediately checks ALL checkboxes (preferences, analytics, marketing)
- ✅ Saves to database (localStorage + API if enabled)
- ✅ Banner closes after saving
- ✅ When reopened, shows all checkboxes checked

### 2. Reject All Button
- ✅ Immediately unchecks all optional checkboxes
- ✅ Only "Necessary" remains checked (always required)
- ✅ Saves to database
- ✅ Banner closes after saving
- ✅ When reopened, shows only necessary checked

### 3. Save Preferences Button
- ✅ Saves whatever checkboxes are currently selected
- ✅ Saves to database
- ✅ Banner closes after saving
- ✅ When reopened, shows the exact preferences that were saved

### 4. Database Integration
- ✅ Loads preferences from localStorage (primary storage)
- ✅ Falls back to API if localStorage is empty
- ✅ Updates database on every save action
- ✅ Reads latest preferences when banner reopens

### 5. Banner Reopening
- ✅ Click "Cookie Settings" button to reopen
- ✅ Automatically loads latest preferences from database
- ✅ Checkboxes reflect current saved state
- ✅ User can modify and save again
