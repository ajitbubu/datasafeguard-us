## Alt Text Best Practices

### Good Alt Text Examples:

**❌ Bad**: `alt="image1"`
**✅ Good**: `alt="Data privacy dashboard showing GDPR compliance metrics and real-time monitoring"`

**❌ Bad**: `alt="screenshot"`
**✅ Good**: `alt="DataSafeguard consent management interface with cookie banner customization options"`

**❌ Bad**: `alt="team"`
**✅ Good**: `alt="Sarah Chen, Chief Privacy Officer at DataSafeguard, presenting at GDPR Summit 2024"`

### Alt Text Formula:
```
[What it is] + [What it shows] + [Context/Action]
```

Examples:
- "Data classification dashboard displaying sensitive data categories across cloud environments"
- "AI governance workflow diagram showing model training, validation, and deployment stages"
- "GDPR compliance checklist with automated policy enforcement and audit trail features"

## Image Optimization Checklist

### For Each Image:

- [ ] **Format**: Use WebP with JPEG fallback
- [ ] **Size**: Optimize to <200KB (use tools like TinyPNG, Squoosh)
- [ ] **Dimensions**: Serve appropriate sizes for different viewports
- [ ] **Alt Text**: Descriptive, keyword-rich (but natural)
- [ ] **File Name**: Descriptive, hyphenated (e.g., `gdpr-compliance-dashboard.webp`)
- [ ] **Lazy Loading**: Use Next.js Image component with lazy loading
- [ ] **Responsive**: Provide srcset for different screen sizes

### Next.js Image Component Example:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/images/gdpr-compliance-dashboard.webp"
  alt="GDPR compliance dashboard showing data subject requests, consent management, and audit logs"
  width={1200}
  height={630}
  loading="lazy"
  quality={85}
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL="data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
/>
```

## Image Naming Convention

### Current Structure:
```
/public
  /images
    /blog
      - gdpr-compliance-guide.webp
      - ai-governance-best-practices.webp
      - data-mapping-discovery.webp
    /products
      - data-discovery-platform.webp
      - consent-management-system.webp
      - ai-security-dashboard.webp
    /team
      - sarah-chen-cpo.webp
      - john-smith-cto.webp
    /solutions
      - compliance-automation.webp
      - privacy-management.webp
    /og
      - og-banner.png (1200x630 for social sharing)
```

### Naming Rules:
1. Use lowercase
2. Separate words with hyphens
3. Include primary keyword
4. Be descriptive but concise
5. Include image type if relevant (dashboard, diagram, screenshot)

**Examples**:
- ✅ `gdpr-compliance-automation-dashboard.webp`
- ✅ `ai-model-security-workflow-diagram.webp`
- ✅ `data-classification-results-screenshot.webp`
- ❌ `image1.jpg`
- ❌ `Screenshot 2024-10-10.png`
- ❌ `IMG_1234.jpg`

## Image Performance Optimization

### Tools to Use:

1. **Compression**:
   - [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) - PNG/JPEG compression
   - [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) - WebP conversion
   - [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) - Mac app for batch optimization

2. **Format Conversion**:
   - Convert all images to WebP
   - Keep JPEG as fallback for older browsers
   - Use PNG only for logos/icons with transparency

3. **Responsive Images**:
   - Generate 3 sizes: mobile (640px), tablet (1024px), desktop (1920px)
   - Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization

### Optimization Script:

```bash
# Install sharp for image processing
npm install sharp

# Create optimization script
node scripts/optimize-images.js
```
