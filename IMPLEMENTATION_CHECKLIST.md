# Implementation Checklist
## Cross-Domain Consent Synchronization

Use this checklist to track your implementation progress.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Setup & Installation

- [ ] Review all implementation artifacts and documentation
- [ ] Read `CONSENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` thoroughly
- [ ] Make `setup-consent.sh` executable: `chmod +x setup-consent.sh`
- [ ] Run setup script: `./setup-consent.sh`
- [ ] Verify all dependencies installed
- [ ] Check `.env.local` configuration
- [ ] Review domain configuration in `server/consent-api/index.js`

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Development Testing

### Local Environment
- [ ] Start frontend: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Start backend: `cd server/consent-api && npm run dev`
- [ ] Frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Backend accessible at http://localhost:3001
- [ ] No console errors on startup

### Consent Banner Testing
- [ ] Consent banner appears on first visit
- [ ] "Accept All" button works
- [ ] "Reject All" button works
- [ ] "Show Details" expands categories
- [ ] Individual category toggles work
- [ ] "Save Preferences" persists selection
- [ ] Banner disappears after consent given
- [ ] Banner doesn't reappear on page reload

### Browser Storage Testing
- [ ] Open Developer Tools → Application → Local Storage
- [ ] Key `ds_consent_v2` exists with consent data
- [ ] Open Developer Tools → Application → Cookies
- [ ] Cookie `consent_user_id` is set
- [ ] Cookie has correct attributes (SameSite, Secure, etc.)

### Backend API Testing
- [ ] Backend logs show server started successfully
- [ ] Health check works: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
- [ ] Check endpoint works: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/consent/check`
- [ ] Save endpoint works (test via UI or curl)
- [ ] Backend logs show AUDIT entries when consent saved
- [ ] Stats endpoint works: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/consent/stats`

### Iframe Management Testing
- [ ] Add test iframe with `data-src` attribute
- [ ] Set `data-consent-category="marketing"`
- [ ] Iframe shows placeholder when marketing consent rejected
- [ ] Placeholder has vendor name and "Allow" button
- [ ] Click "Allow" button shows consent banner
- [ ] After accepting marketing consent, iframe loads
- [ ] Revoke consent blocks iframe again

### Console Logging
- [ ] Check browser console for `[ConsentProvider]` logs
- [ ] Check browser console for `[ConsentAPI]` logs
- [ ] Check backend terminal for `[AUDIT]` logs
- [ ] No errors or warnings in console
- [ ] Logs show "Consent loaded from: local" or "cross-domain"

### Cross-Tab Sync Testing
- [ ] Open page in Tab 1
- [ ] Accept consent in Tab 1
- [ ] Open page in Tab 2 (same domain)
- [ ] Tab 2 should not show banner
- [ ] Revoke consent in Tab 1
- [ ] Tab 2 should show banner again (may need refresh)

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Cross-Domain Testing

### Setup Local Cross-Domain Testing
- [ ] Edit `/etc/hosts` file
- [ ] Add: `127.0.0.1 local.datasafeguard.us`
- [ ] Add: `127.0.0.1 local.datasafeguard.ai`
- [ ] Update `.env.local` with test domains
- [ ] Update `server/consent-api/index.js` DOMAIN_GROUPS
- [ ] Restart both servers

### Cross-Domain Sync Testing
- [ ] Visit http://local.datasafeguard.us:3000
- [ ] Banner appears on first visit
- [ ] Accept consent on Domain A
- [ ] Check localStorage on Domain A
- [ ] Check cookie on Domain A
- [ ] Visit http://local.datasafeguard.ai:3000
- [ ] Banner should NOT appear on Domain B
- [ ] Check localStorage on Domain B (should have consent data)
- [ ] Check cookie on Domain B (should be same user ID)
- [ ] Revoke consent on Domain B
- [ ] Refresh Domain A
- [ ] Banner should appear again on Domain A

### Jurisdiction Testing (Optional)
- [ ] Test GDPR mode (default behavior)
- [ ] Test CCPA mode (check GPC detection)
- [ ] Test DPDP mode (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify button text changes per jurisdiction
- [ ] Verify banner text changes per jurisdiction

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Code Quality & Review

### Code Review

## 🆘 Emergency Procedures

### If Consent System Fails
1. Check backend API status
2. Check database connectivity
3. Review error logs
4. Roll back to previous version if critical
5. Show fallback banner (local only)
6. Notify legal team

### If Cross-Domain Sync Fails
1. Check CORS configuration
2. Verify cookie settings
3. Check HTTPS on all domains
4. Verify domain group configuration
5. Fall back to per-domain consent if needed
